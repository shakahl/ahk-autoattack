# AutoAttack

An [AutoHotKey](http://autohotkey.com/) script that lets you hold down ``spacebar`` to make repeated mouse clicks.

This script is great for ARPG games that are very clicky, such as Diablo and Torchlight, saving you from developing carpal tunnel syndrome.  When the script is running you can toggle it on / off by hitting the ``capslock`` key.

## Usage

- Install [AutoHotKey](http://autohotkey.com/).
- Download this script.
- Right click and "Run As Administrator".
- Hit ``capslock`` to toggle the script on/off.
